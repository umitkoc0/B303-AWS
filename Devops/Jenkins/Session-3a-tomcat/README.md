# Hands-on Jenkins-03a : Install & Configure Tomcat on Amazon Linux 2023 AWS EC2 Instances

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to install & configure Tomcat server.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- install and configure Tomcat server.


## Outline

- Part 1 - Launch an EC-2 instance and connect using SSH

- Part 2 - Install Java JDK

- Part 3 - Install Tomcat

- Part 4 - Configure Tomcat

- Part 5 - Auto start of tomcat server at boot

## Part 1 - Launch an EC-2 instance and connect using SSH

- Launch an AWS EC2 instance of Amazon Linux 2023 AMI with instance type:t2.micro and a security group allowing SSH and TCP 8080 ports.

- Connect to the instance with SSH.

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/call-training.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-133-106-98.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## Part 2 - Install Java JDK

- Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

- Install Java

- For Centos & Fedora (Amazon ec-2 instance)

```bash
sudo dnf install java-21-amazon-corretto -y
```

## Part 3 - Install Tomcat


- For Centos & Fedora (Amazon ec-2 instance)
  
```bash
sudo dnf install unzip wget -y
```

- Install Tomcat

- Got to https://tomcat.apache.org/download-11.cgi page

- Look at Binary Distributions and copy the link of the `zip`ed one.

```bash
...
Core:
zip (pgp, sha512) [select this for linux, thus copy the link]
tar.gz (pgp, sha512)
32-bit Windows zip (pgp, sha512)
64-bit Windows zip (pgp, sha512)
32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer (pgp, sha512)
...
```

-  Get the tomcat file
  
```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-11/v11.0.6/bin/apache-tomcat-11.0.6.zip
```

- Unzip tomcat file and move to `/opt`
  
```bash
unzip apache-tomcat-*.zip
sudo mv apache-tomcat-11.0.6 /opt/tomcat
```

## Part 4 - Configure tomcat

- Change Permission of Scripts in `/opt/tomcat/bin`

```bash
cd /opt/tomcat/bin
ls -la
sudo chmod +x *
ls -al
```

- Set Credentials of Tomcat that Jenkins will use.

```bash
cd /opt/tomcat/conf
```
- Update `tomcat-users.xml` file.

```bash
sudo vim tomcat-users.xml
```
- `manager-script` & `admin-gui` are needed for jenkins to access tomcat.

- Set roles as `manager-script` & `admin-gui` and set password to tomcat as follows:

```bash
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-script, admin-gui, manager-gui"/>
```

- Note : Don't forget to remove the xml comment bloks `<!--` and `-->`. Delete these enclosing lines.

- To configure Tomcat server we need to modify the content of the context.xml. Be careful there are two of this file. We have to modify both of them.

- Go to the `/opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/` and edit file `context.xml`. Actually commenting out the tagged `CookieProcessor` and `Valve` parts.

```bash
cd /opt/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/
ls
sudo vim context.xml
```

```bash

- Restart the tomcat server

```bash
sudo /opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
sudo /opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
```

## Part 5 - Auto start of Tomcat server at boot

- In able to auto start Tomcat server at boot, we have to make it a `service`. Service is process that starts with operating system and runs in the background without interacting with the user.

- Service files are located in /etc/systemd/system.

- Go to /etc/systemd/system folder.

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system
```

- In able to declare a service "unit file" must be created. Create a `tomcat.service` file.

```bash
sudo vim tomcat.service
```

- Copy and paste this code in "tomcat.service" file.
```
[Unit]
Description=Apache Tomcat Web Application Container
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking

Environment=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre
Environment=CATALINA_PID=/opt/tomcat/temp/tomcat.pid
Environment=CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat
Environment=CATALINA_BASE=/opt/tomcat
Environment='CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -server -XX:+UseParallelGC'
Environment='JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom'

ExecStart=/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
ExecStop=/bin/kill -15 $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Save and exit.

- Enable Tomcat server.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable tomcat
```

- Start Tomcat server.

```bash
sudo systemctl start tomcat
```

- Open your browser, get your Tomcat server ec2 instance Public IPv4 DNS and paste it at address bar with 8080. 
"http://[ec2-public-dns-name]:8080"
