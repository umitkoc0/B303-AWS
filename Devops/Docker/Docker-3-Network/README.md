## Outline

- Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Part 2 - Default Network Bridge in Docker

- Part 3 - User-defined Network Bridge in Docker

- Part 4 - Container Networking

## Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Launch a Docker machine on  Ubuntu 24.04 AMI with security group allowing SSH connections using the [Cloudformation Template for Docker Machine Installation].

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/first_pem ubuntu@ec2-3-133-106-98.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

## Part 2 - Default Network Bridge in Docker

- Check if the docker service is up and running.

```bash
systemctl status docker
```

- List all networks available in Docker, and explain types of networks.

```bash
docker network ls
```

- Run two `alpine` containers with interactive shell, in detached mode, name the container as `techpro1st` and `techpro2nd`, and add command to run alpine shell. Here, explain what the detached mode means.

```bash
docker container run -dit --name techpro1st alpine ash
docker container run -dit --name techpro2nd alpine ash
```

- Show the list of running containers on Docker machine.

```bash
docker ps
```

- Show the details of `bridge` network, and explain properties (subnet, ips) and why containers are in the default network bridge.

```bash
docker network inspect bridge | less
q
```

- Get the IP of `techpro2nd` container.

```bash
docker container inspect techpro2nd | grep IPAddress
```

- Connect to the `techpro1st` container.

```bash
docker container exec -it techpro1st ash
docker container attach techpro1st
```

- Show the details of network interface configuration of `techpro1st` container.

```bash
ifconfig
```

- Open an other terminal and connect your ec2 instance. Show the details of network interface configuration of ec2 instance. 

```bash
ifconfig
```

- Compare with two configurations.

- In the `techpro1st` container ping google.com four times to check internet connection.

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

- Ping `techpro2nd `container by its IP four times to show the connection.

```bash
ping -c 4 172.17.0.3
```

- Try to ping `techpro2nd `container by its name, should face with bad address. Explain why failed (due to default bridge configuration not works with container names)

```bash
ping -c 4 techpro2nd
```

- Disconnect from `techpro1st` without stopping it (CTRL + p + q).

- Stop and delete the containers

```bash
docker container stop techpro1st techpro2nd
docker container rm techpro1st techpro2nd
```

## Part 3 - User-defined Network Bridge in Docker

- Create a bridge network `techpronet`.

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge techpronet
```

- List all networks available in Docker, and show the user-defined `techpronet`.

```bash
docker network ls
```

- Show the details of `techpronet`, and show that there is no container yet.

```bash
docker network inspect techpronet
```

- Run four `alpine` containers with interactive shell, in detached mode, name the containers as `techpro1st`, `techpro2nd`, `techpro3rd` and `techpro4th`, and add command to run alpine shell. Here, 1st and 2nd containers should be in `techpronet`, 3rd container should be in default network bridge, 4th container should be in both `techpronet` and default network bridge.

```bash
docker container run -dit --network techpronet --name techpro1st alpine ash
docker container run -dit --network techpronet --name techpro2nd alpine ash
docker container run -dit --name techpro3rd alpine ash
docker container run -dit --name techpro4th alpine ash
docker network connect techpronet techpro4th
```

- List all running containers and show there up and running.

```bash
docker container ls
```

- Show the details of `techpronet`, and explain newly added containers. (1st, 2nd, and 4th containers should be in the list)

```bash
docker network inspect techpronet
```

- Show the details of  default network bridge, and explain newly added containers. (3rd and 4th containers should be in the list)

```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```

- Connect to the `techpro1st` container.

```bash
docker exec -it techpro1st ash
docker attach techpro1st
```

- Ping `techpro2nd` and `techpro4th` container by its name to show that in user-defined network, container names can be used in networking.

```bash
ping -c 4 techpro2nd
ping -c 4 techpro4th
```

- Try to ping `techpro3rd` container by its name and IP, should face with bad address because 3rd container is in different network.

```bash
ping -c 4 techpro3rd
ping -c 4 172.17.0.2
```

- Ping google.com to check internet connection.

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

- Exit the `techpro1st` container without stopping and return to ubuntu bash shell.

- Connect to the `techpro4th` container, since it is in both network should connect all containers.

```bash
docker  exec -it techpro4th ash
```

- Ping `techpro2nd` and `techpro1st` container by its name, ping `techpro3rd` container with its IP. Explain why used IP, instead of name.

```bash
ping -c 4 techpro1st
ping -c 4 techpro2nd
ping -c 4 172.17.0.2
```

- Exit from `techpro4th` container. Stop and remove all containers.

```bash
docker container stop techpro1st techpro2nd techpro3rd techpro4th
docker container rm techpro1st techpro2nd techpro3rd techpro4th
```

- Delete `techpronet` network

```bash
docker network rm techpronet
```

## Part 4 - Container Networking

- Run a `nginx` web server, name the container as `ng`, and bind the web server to host port 8080 command to run alpine shell. Explain `--rm` and `-p` flags and port binding.

```bash
docker container run --rm -d -p 8080:80 --name ng nginx
```

- Add a security rule for protocol HTTP port 8080 and show Nginx Web Server is running on Docker Machine.

```text
http://ec2-18-232-70-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080
```

- Stop container `ng`, should be removed automatically due to `--rm` flag.

```bash
docker container stop ng
```
## network host 

- Run a `nginx` web server, name the container as `my_nginx`, and connect the web server to host network. 

```bash
docker container run --rm -dit --network host --name my_nginx nginx
```

- Show Nginx Web Server is running on Docker Machine.

```text
http://ec2-18-232-70-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

- Show the details of network interface configuration of `my_nginx` container.

```bash
docker container exec -it my_nginx sh
ifconfig
apt-get update
apt-get install net-tools
ifconfig
```

- Open an other terminal and connect your ec2 instance. Show the details of network interface configuration of ec2 instance. 

```bash
ifconfig
```

- Show that two configurations are the same. 

- Exit and stop container `my_nginx`, should be removed automatically due to `--rm` flag.

```bash
docker container stop my_nginx
```

##  None network

- Run an `alpine` container, name the container as `nullcontainer`, and connect the web server to none network. 

```bash
docker container run --rm -it --network none --name nullcontainer alpine
```

- Show the details of network interface configuration of `nullcontainer` container.

```bash
ifconfig
```

- Notice that it has only loopback(localhost) interface.

- Try to ping `google.com`, should face with bad address. Explain why failed (due to none network configuration)

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

- Exit from container `nullcontainer`, should be removed automatically due to `--rm` flag.

```bash
docker container rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```
